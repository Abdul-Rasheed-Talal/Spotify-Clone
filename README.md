# Spotify Frontend Clone 🎧

A Spotify-inspired music streaming web application developed as a **portfolio project** to demonstrate frontend development skills, dynamic data handling, and audio playback functionality.

## 🚀 Features
- Albums are dynamically loaded using a JSON data source  
- Each album contains multiple songs with metadata  
- Click on an album to view and load its songs  
- Play, pause, and switch between tracks  
- Smooth and responsive user interface  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- JSON (for albums and songs data)

## 📂 Project Structure
- Album and song data is stored in JSON files  
- Albums are rendered dynamically on the home page  
- Selecting an album loads its songs without page reload  
- Audio playback is handled using JavaScript audio APIs  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Working with JSON data
